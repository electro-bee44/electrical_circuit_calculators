Tank Circuits

A parallel combination of a capacitor and inductor forms a tank circuit. It is the most common "resonant" circuit. When operating at the resonant frequency, an LC tank circuit absorbs maximum power.

This tool is designed using simple C++ algorithms to calculate the resonant frequency of a tank circuit if the capacitance and inductance values are known. Using the formula: fr = 1/(2π√LC) , 
where:
fr = resonant frequency (Hz)
L = circuit inductance (H)
C = circuit capacitance (F)

Using this tool, it becomes simpler to calculate the desired values of the inductors and capacitors required for a desired frequency.
